# Generating_Music_Makrov_Chains
Course: Stochastic Simulation We used 2,3 ordered Markov Chains in order to capture the musical rules important for melody in the form of a simple notes transition frequency table. We trained the model using a Beethoven Corpus and then generated new melodies. We experimented with different orders, note length and pitch. The melodies produced were simple yet pleasant to here.

Generator.py 'learns' from the MIDI corpus and then generates new music.

Inspect can be used to find more information about the MIDI files.

The results of the experiments have been put in Pictures and can be heard as MIDI
files.

Our group presentation has more information about the underlying theory.
